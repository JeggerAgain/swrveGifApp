# swrveGifApp

App For SWRVE which has the following features:

 - A control to show latest Cats or Dog results.

 - Results view with paging of 25 GIFs per page.

 - A detail view which shows the selected GIF when clicked.

The app uses a revealing module pattern which only exposes certain functions and only adds one variable to the Global Name space. 

Due to the simple nature of the app I have chosen to not use any JS framework. 


To Do: 
- Jasmine Unit Tests
- Media Queries to fix margins on mobile
- Change cursor to pointer on Filter and Arrows to indicate clickable
